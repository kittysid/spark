<div id="four">   Ganesh Chaturthi 2023: Significance Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated to mark the birth of Lord Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom, prosperity, and good luck. Lord Ganesha is believed to be the remover of obstacles and the giver of good fortune. The festival is also a time for Hindus to come together and celebrate their culture and heritage. Ganesh Chaturthi is a joyous occasion that is marked by feasting, dancing, and other festivities. Ganesh Chaturthi 2023: Vrat Katha In Hindu mythology, Goddess Parvati created Ganesha from sandalwood paste in the absence of Lord Shiva to guard her while she takes a bath. When Lord Shiva tried to enter, Ganesha stopped him, leading to an argument. Adhering to his mother's command, Ganesha blocked Lord Shiva's path. This left Lord Shiva in anger and he separated Ganesha's head from his body. After seeing this, Goddess Parvati transformed into her Kali avatar and threatened to destroy the universe in anger. Shiva then realized his mistake and replaced Ganesha's head with that of an elephant. The event represents the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.</div>
